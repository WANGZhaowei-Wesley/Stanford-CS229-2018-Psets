\begin{answer}\\
(i) No. The theta will still arbitrarily increase but in a slow speed.\\
(ii)Yes. This modification will make the learning rate decreasing very quickly in order to force the algorithm to stop updating the $\theta$.\\
(iii) No. The dataset will still be linear separable.\\
(iv) Yes. This will prevent $\theta$ to be arbitrarily large.\\
(v) No. Actually, the result depends on how much the noise is. It should be large enough to make the dataset not linearly separable. If the noise is small, the linear-separable-dataset problem is still not solved.
